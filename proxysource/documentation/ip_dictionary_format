This file describes the format in which proxy ip information should be stored by all modules.
Downstream code should be written to assume that this is true, and any non conformance should be fixed in the module.

The output shall be a dictionary with the following structure:

data_out = {
    'data_valid': [True|False] # The presence of this field indicates that the rest of the data is valid, and can be processed
    'data': {} # This field is itself a dictionary of all the proxies being returned.
}

The data has sequentially enumerated keys ranging from 0 to n, where  n is the number of proxies returned. It has the following structure:

data = {
    'ip': [str] # This is the string representation of the ip address, e.g. 123.5.71.89
    'port': [str] # This is the port to use when connecting to the proxy
    'https': [True|False] # This indicates whether the proxy is suitable for https pages (unknown = False)
    'google': [True|False] # This indicates whether the proxy goes through Google (I think)
    'anon': [0|1|2|3] # Indicates the anonymity of the proxy, 0 = unknown, 1 = transparent, 2 = anonymous, 3 = elite
    'country': [AB] # Two letter country code to identify the exit country. (Unknown = XX)
}
